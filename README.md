# Parked

My final work school project made in Flutter.

Parked is a mobile application that is going to help people to find and offer parking places in several major cities. This will be a community-based application where anyone can rent or reserve a parking place.

## Getting Started

if you want to launch the application on your computer you will first need to install flutter.

For help getting started with Flutter, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Once install, make sure that all the packages are installed. You can install with the command line:

```
$ flutter pub get
```
## Run the application 

> First ensure **`flutter doctor`** runs good and all necessary components are installed.

### IOS

* Then manually opened the Simulator app in the Mac.
* Then ensure the simulator shows up in **`flutter devices`**.
* Now if you run the **`flutter run`** command, it built the app for iOS and ran on the iOS Simulator.

### Android

* Then manually opened the Simulator app on your computer.
* Then ensure the simulator shows up in **`flutter devices`**.
* Now if you run the **`flutter run`** command, it built the app for Android and ran on the Android Simulator.

### Multiple simulators

* Then manually opened your Simulators apps on your computer. **_Note: For iOS you need a mac_**.
* If you run the **`flutter run -d all`** command, it built the app on your open Simulators.

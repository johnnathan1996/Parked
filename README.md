# parked

My final work school project made in Flutter.

Parkly is a mobile application that is going to help people to find and offer parking places in several major cities. This will be a community-based application where anyone can rent or reserve a parking place.

## Getting Started

if you want to launch the application on your computer you will first need to install flutter.

For help getting started with Flutter, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

once install, make sure that all the packages are installed, to do this, you can install with the command line:

```
$ flutter pub get
```
